This project uses libavcodec from the ffmpeg or libav projects to
provide VP8 decoding in the Go Programming Language.

BUILDING

If your system doesn't provide libavcodec (or it's incompatible with
this code) and you want to build ffmpeg/libav from source, proceed as
follows:

cd <ffmpeg or libav sources directory>
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --enable-shared --prefix=$HOME/golibs
make install

You'll need to tell cgo where to find your libavcodec
libraries. Assuming you installed to $HOME/golibs in the previous
step, add something like this to your .bashrc or wherever you setup
your environment variables:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$HOME/golibs
